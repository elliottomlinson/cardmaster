# Cardmaster

A simplified tabletop role-playing game with an emphasis on casual play.

## The Card System

As a *Cardmaster*, the player has a hand of single-use cards which allow them to use magical abilities instantly *at any time* during play.

</p>

Since the **âš¡ Cast Effect** applies instantly, the seemingly lackluster _Shift_ could be used to dodge a bullet, if played on an opponent's turn. 

In the same situation, cards such as 
  <i><a href="#Fluster" title="âš¡ Decrease the result of a roll by 1">Fluster</a></i>, 
  <i><a href="#Gust of Wind" title="âš¡ Throw a visible character up into the air">Gust of Wind</a></i>, and 
  <i><a href="#Anvil Drop" title="âš¡ Summon a cast-steel anvil into existence above target character's head">Anvil Drop</a></i> 
could be used to interfere.

</p>

During an ally's turn,
  <i><a href="#Field Medicine" title="âš¡ Heal a visible character 15. They can move twice as fast for the remainder of the session &#013;âœ‹ Run twice as fast while carrying friendly characters">Field Medicine</a></i> or
  <i><a href="#Pigeon Partner" title="âš¡ Summon a pigeon to perform a simple task">Pigeon Partner</a></i>
could be cast to help them. Cards like 
  <i><a href="#Lie" title="âš¡ Target NPC will believe your next statement">Lie</a></i> and
  <i><a href="#Seance" title="âš¡ Speak with any dead NPC. Their voice can be heard by all nearby NPCs.">Seance</a></i>
can affect social interactions and may be most useful outside of combat.

</p>

Players have the freedom to manipulate the environment to varying degrees with cards like 
  <i><a href="#Barrier" title="âš¡ Summon an impenetrable column of light in adjacent square metre for 5 minutes">Barrier</a></i>,
  <i><a href="#Soak" title="âš¡ Cause everything within 2 metres of a visible object to become saturated with water">Soak</a></i>, and
  <i><a href="#Poltergeist" title="âš¡ Possess a non-magic object within 5 tiles of your body until you lose concentration.">Poltergeist</a></i>.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elliottomlinson/cardmaster/master/res/card/generated/Barrier.png" width="25%" 
       id="Barrier" title="âš¡ Summon an impenetrable column of light in adjacent square metre for 5 minutes">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elliottomlinson/cardmaster/master/res/card/generated/Soak.png" width="25%" 
       id="Soak" title="âš¡ Cause everything within 2 metres of a visible object to become saturated with water">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elliottomlinson/cardmaster/master/res/card/generated/Poltergeist.png" width="25%" 
       id="Poltergeist" title="âš¡ Possess a non-magic object within 5 tiles of your body until you lose concentration.">
</p>

Cards can also have an effect while in a player's hand, as denoted by the **âœ‹ Hand Effect** symbol. Cards with these effects, such as 
  <i><a href="#Rodent Whisperer" title="âš¡ Turn into a rodent for as long as you want &#013;âœ‹ You hold influence over members of Order Rodentia">Rodent Whisperer</a></i>,
  <i><a href="#Slingshot" title="âš¡ Launch a baseball sized rock at a visible target &#013;âœ‹ Gain advantage when throwing objects">Slingshot</a></i>, and
  <i><a href="#Lover Fatale" title="âš¡ A visible NPC develops feelings for you &#013;âœ‹ Attacks against characters who love you deal 25 bonus damage">Lover Fatale</a></i>
can help define a character's identity.

       id="Lover Fatale" title="âš¡ A visible NPC develops feelings for you &#013;âœ‹ Attacks against characters who love you deal 25 bonus damage">

Cardmaster's tier/rarity order is: âš« Grey, ðŸ”µ Blue, ðŸŸ¢ Green, ðŸ”´ Red, ðŸŸ¡ Gold. The player can upgrade a card of a certain tier in exchange for three cards of the same tier. Some cards belong to a series - guaranteeing a particular result when upgrading them, as shown below with 

  <i><a href="#Spark" title="âš¡ Deal 3 damage to a visible character with a painful bolt of electricity">Spark</a></i>,
  <i><a href="#Lightning Bolt" title="âš¡ Deal 4 damage and stun up to 2 visible characters.">Lightning Bolt</a></i>, and
  <i><a href="#Fork Lightning" title="âš¡ Deal 6 damage and stun to up to 6 visible characters.">Fork Lightning</a></i>.
   <i><a href="#Elektra's Siphon" title="âš¡Cause a complete blackout in a 100 kilometre radius. Draw 3 copies of Fork Lightning.">Elektra's Siphon</a></i>.

Certain cards like 
 <i><a href="#Untimely Death" title="âš¡ Name an NPC. They will be suddenly inspired to seek greatness. By next session they will be incredibly powerful.">Untimely Death</a></i>, and 
 <i><a href="#Heroic Inspiration" title="âš¡ Name a character not on the current map. They die.">Heroic Inspiration</a></i>
can even be used to influence the campaign at-large.
