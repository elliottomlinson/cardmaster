Cardmaster is a simplified tabletop roleplaying card game which emphasizes casual play.

Players play as "Cardmasters", who have a hand of single-use cards which allow them to use magical abilities at **any** time, even if it isn't their turn.

Consider the card "Shift":

At first glance, this ability is underwhelming. However, when cast just as an enemy makes an attack, it acts as a reliable escape. The effect of a card applies instantaneously, so "Shift" can even be used to dodge bullets.

### Cards Have Many Uses:

During an opponent's turn, players can look for ways to interrupt their plans with cards like "Distract":

During an ally's turn, the player can look for an opportunity to help with cards like "Boost":

Cards such as "Lie" can be useful outside of combat to help in social interactions:

Cards can also have an effect while in a player's hand, as denoted by the ✋ symbol. Cards with these effects like "Rodent Whisperer" help define a character's identity:

Cards like "Untimely Death" can even be used to influence the story itself:
