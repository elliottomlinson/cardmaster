# Cardmaster

A simplified tabletop role-playing game with an emphasis on casual play.

## The Card System

As a *Cardmaster*, the player has a hand of single-use cards which allow them to use magical abilities instantly *at any time* during play.

Since the **âš¡ Cast Effect** applies instantly, the seemingly lackluster _Shift_ could be used to dodge a bullet, if played on an opponent's turn. 

In the same situation, cards such as *Fluster*, *Gust of Wind*, and *Anvil Drop* could be used to interfere.

During an ally's turn, *Field Medicine* and *Pigeon Partner* could be cast to help them. Cards like *Lie* and *Seance* can affect social interactions and may be most useful outside of combat.

Players have the freedom to manipulate the environment to varying degrees with cards like *Eidolimb*, *Soak*, and *Poltergeist*.

</p>

Cards can also have an effect while in a player's hand, as denoted by the **âœ‹ Hand Effect** symbol. Cards with these effects, such as *Rodent Whisperer*, *Slingshot*, and *Lover Fatale*, can help define a character's identity.

Cardmaster's tier/rarity order is: âš« Grey, ðŸ”µ Blue, ðŸŸ¢ Green, ðŸ”´ Red, ðŸŸ¡ Gold. The player can upgrade a card of a certain tier in exchange for three cards of the same tier. Some cards belong to a series - guaranteeing a particular result when upgrading them, as shown below with *Spark*, *Lightning Bolt*, *Fork Lightning*, and finally *Elektra's Siphon*.

Certain cards like *Untimely Death* and *Heroic Inspiration* can even be used to influence the campaign/story itself.
