# Tabletop 101

For those unfamiliar with popular Tabletop Roleplaying games like [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/), here's a quick guide:

A Tabletop Roleplaying game is a game in which the players assume new identities and play out a simulated adventure with the aid of a game master(GM). To play the game, players describe what they'd like their character to do, and the GM determines the outcome of that action on the game world. Dice rolls are used determine how successful players are at each action.

To demonstrate, here's dialogue from an example game:

**GM:** "You wake up in a bare white room with a steel door."

**Player:** "I attempt to use telepathy to rip the door off its hinges. I've rolled a 20 sided dice and it landed on 6."

**GM:** "You focus your mind, but since you aren't telepathic, the door does not budge."

**Player:** "I'll try to kick the door down. This time I rolled an 18."

**GM:** "The door bursts open as you kick it, allowing you to escape."

# D20s and Special Rolls

When determining the success of an action a player has decided to take, the player rolls a 20 sided dice. Lower numbers indicate failure, and higher numbers indicate success. There are two special values, critical success(20) and critical failure(1).

When a player rolls a critical success, the GM selects the best possible result for their actions, even if it seems implausible. Here's an example:

**GM:** "The security guard turns the corner and spots you leaving the vault with a bag of cash."

**Player:** "I tell the guard that I'm doing renovations on the vault, and the bag is full of tools. I've rolled a 20."

**GM:** "The security guard thanks you for your service and leaves you to your work"

Conversely, when a player rolls a critical failure, the GM selects the worst possible result for their actions, even if it seems implausible. Here's an example:

**GM:** "You spot a wealthy man leaving the bank after making a large withdrawal."

**Player:** "I try to steal the wallet out of his pocket. I rolled a 1."

**GM:** "As you try to pick his pocket, you trip over your shoe laces and stumble into the middle of the street right in front of a patrolling police cruiser."

# Health, Damage, and Death

Characters start some amount of health, or hit points(HP). Hit points are reduced by damage. Games differ in the result of reaching 0 HP, but in Cardmaster the character dies. Here's an example game:

Player: "I swing at the troll with all of my might."

GM: "The mountain troll steps on you, dealing 8 damage and bringing you to 0 HP, killing you."

There are a number of ways to restore hitpoints as well which differ from game to game. In Cardmaster, you start each session with at least 20 hit points.

# Combat and Turn Taking

Typically players can take actions at any time and in any order. The exception to this is combat. Combat typically entails a fight with non-player characters(NPCs), but it could also entail any other competition where it's important to simulate that actions are happening simultaneously, such as a chase. To do this, characters take turns taking actions. In Cardmaster, all players share a turn, and all NPCs share a turn. Here's an example game:

Player 1: "I swing my fist at the tallest mountain troll."

GM: "The troll is dealt 3 damage. Combat begins, it's now the Trolls turn. He attempts to swing his club at you and misses. Now it's the player's turn."

Player 2: "I sneak behind the mountain troll on all fours"

Player 1: "I push the mountain troll backwards over Player 1"

GM: "The troll is dealt 4 damage and dies. Combat is now over."
