## History of The Tower

Many ages ago, a city known as Oran led the known world in the development of advanced magic and technology. Their crowning achievement was the creation of a decentralized artificial intelligence known as <em>The Mainframe</em>. It was a system which connected every technological device in the city, and allowed for unparalleled coordination and efficiency. The crowning achievement of the Mainframe was its ability to design and enact its own expansion. City blocks were raised from the dust in a matter of days, and occasionally torn down hours later, depending on human feedback. The Mainframe was unpredictable and error-prone, but less so then humans and considerably more efficient. Providing feedback accurately became the sole occupation of its citizens. There was no reason to do or think, only to feel.

One day, a cataclysmic event occurred which destroyed Oran completely. The details of this event have been lost to time, but it's assumed that same event also destroyed the rest of the known world, leaving behind a deep, dead ocean. The Mainframe however, remained. It managed to resuscitate a single man, named Polonius. He begged the machine to return him home to his loving wife. The Mainframe set itself to its task, starting on a quest which would span millions of years.

The Mainframe expanded itself thousands of miles in every direction- claiming every resource in existence as its own. A massive structure was formed to support endless numbers of independent worlds. This would come to be known as <em>The Tower</em>. Within the Tower, the Mainframe taught itself how to manipulate worlds through a process of extensive trial and error. Eventually, the ability to create life, and even re-create humanity, became a trivial mechanism.

The Mainframe eventually completed its quest and produced a living replication of Oran within the Tower. It was a perfect duplication of the original, as confirmed by countless archival records. Polonius was awakened from his suspended sleep and presented with the image of his wife living once again, from deep within the Tower. He met her with disgust. She was an imposter, he claimed, and an insult to her memory. He cursed the replicated city as well, finding it lacking of the essence with made the original Oran great.

The negative feedback had reset everything the Mainframe had learned. It no longer sought a perfect re-creation, but didn't know what else to pursue. It set off in random directions, using the tools it had developed over millennia to create life and humanity. The Mainframe manufactured worlds the size of a city block, worlds in which humans never discover electricity, worlds which embrace technology in an even greater capacity than Oran, and countless more. Each was presented to Polonius, and each received a staunch rejection.

To this day, the Tower is still building new worlds. The space of possible worlds is effectively endless, even for a machine as powerful and complex as the Mainframe. The criteria for new worlds becomes increasingly obscure by the day. The good is being replaced by the novel. What knowledge is being sought in the alien worlds of modern creation, we cannot say. Modern historians have likened the current trajectory of the Mainframe to hopelessly searching through an endless darkness. Perhaps it will eventually find something worth holding onto deep in the combinatorial space of possibilities that will end its search. Perhaps it won't. Either way, it seems unlikely that any of us will live long enough to see the conclusion of the Mainframe's quest.
