## Life in the Tower

The Tower is administrated through a network of messaging nodes, each transmitting requests in all directions. Each hop in the network adds some noise into the channel, causing messages from far away to be completely indecipherable. Individual components can be understood and hijacked, but it's impossible to understand the entire network due to its size and complexity. The meaning of data transmitted during the analysis of a world remains a mystery to the human race. What we do know, however, is that the Mainframe is continually creating and salvaging worlds. Of particular interest to us is the salvaging process, in which a world is reduced to its base materials and redistributed throughout the tower. This process eradicates all life within that world, which is a tragedy of unimaginable proportion.

The re-creation of Oran was the first world to wrestle control away from the Mainframe. They narrowly prevented their world from being salvaged by isolating themselves from the Tower's network. Now they have complete control over the technology in their sector, and use it to mass produce weaponry and materials. Led by the re-creation of Polonius, more typically referred to as "The General", they've set out into the Tower on a journey of conquest. They seize nearby worlds, saving the citizenry from the Mainframe and recruiting towards their cause. This group of worlds allied to fight the Mainframe is known as "The Rebels".

Most human related work in the Tower is performed by Agents. Agents are humanoid robots designed to infiltrate and manipulate the development of worlds within the Tower. Their directive is to maximize data collection, which requires the protection of resources and careful influence of important humans. To the primitive worlds, they are Gods. To advanced worlds, they are leaders. To rebel worlds, they are spies. They all belong to distinct Agencies which operate independently, directed by the cryptic messages emitted back and forth over the network. Agencies often disagree with each other on the interpretation of these messages, leading to inner conflict and distrust. They've been engaged in war with the Rebels for over a hundred years, which is their one unifying objective.

Inter-world cartels and companies have formed among the human escapees. Vast fortunes are realized in the unspoiled, resource rich cubes populated by primitive societies. These societies are helpless to defend themselves against the superior technology wielded by their invaders. Their fate is destitution and slavery, as the resources of their world are extracted for external interests. These riches are primarily centralized in an organization simply known as "The Mafia". They enjoy luxury and indulge in all forms of entertainment. A visit to their extravagant mall world or the infamous fighting ring will teach you all you need to know. Their leader is given the title of "The Don", who rules the organization with an iron fist.

Roaming the vast corridors of the Tower are countless vagrants, ejected from their worlds due to war, persecution, or salvage. They seek new hospitable worlds to restart their lives in. Navigating the Tower is no easy task however, and many become lost, never to be seen again. If they're fortunate enough to stumble upon a human faction like the Rebels or the Mafia, they tend to join the ranks as it's preferable to the cold empty space between worlds.
