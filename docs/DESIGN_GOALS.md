# Design Goals

These are the tenants of Cardmaster's design:

### Player Freedom
What makes tabletop games worth playing over board and video games, is the freedom for players to do anything. The freedom of the player to attempt anything should never be constricted.

There are some exceptions to this rule:
- Players must cooperate with other players
- During combat, actions must be taken in turns

### Focus on Roleplaying over Gaming
Existing tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons have rulesets that have been optimized over decades to be engaging to highly dedicated players.
The rules are complete enough that you can have some consistency in gameplay between different DMs as long as their familiar with the rules.
Players can spend time analyzing the game and creating optimal builds based on the rules.

Cardmaster will never offer a similar level of consistency or depth that would engage dedicated players to analyze it.
Instead, game elements are focused on roleplaying and having fun. Each rule and system we add into Cardmaster is carefully weighed between the fun it creates and the complexity it adds.

### Minimize Player Time Commitment

Playing tabletop roleplaying games can be a significant commitment for everyone involved.
The preparation work often takes hours, especially for new players. The sesions themselves will often run for over 4 hours.

With Cardmaster, players do **no preparation work** between sessions. **Sessions last no longer than 90 minutes**.

Gamemasters, however, need to spend time between sessions designing and preparing for the next session. 

### Give Players Unfair Advantages

The cards in cardmaster, and specifically the ability to play them at any time, gives the players an unfair advantage over the other characters in the world.
This unfiar advantage is part of the fun of using cards. Since players should always be cooperating, they should never suffer as a result of a card with a frustrating effect.
