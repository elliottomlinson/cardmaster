# Notes: The Cubes

_With the information you've obtained thus far, you've been able to put together a rudimentary overview of the life-cycle of a Cube within the Tower:_

**1. Initiation Code**

The mainframe requests creation of a world. At this point the sound is indistinguishable from static.

**2. Decentralized Radio Broadcast**

The request is echoed through the Tower Radio.

**3. Pseudorandom Signal Demux**

The first part of the demux, performed by incomprehensibly massive and constantly growing tower computer networks serving as radio stations and relays. The computation done in this stage isn't too alien to us, only the scale of it is fantastical.

**4. Sudorandom Signal Demux**

This stage takes it a step further. A sprawling mechanical-computer-hybrid mechanism that interprets the signal's subtleties to pass arguments to the next stage. The machinery is complicated beyond our understanding and feels almost alive thanks to the way it's constantly being rebuilt and rearranged. Diagnostic lights blink from a trillion small LEDs. Fans whir, coils buzz, and vacuum tubes glow. Punch cards are punched and PCBs are moved along webs of conveyors as the machine builds and upgrades itself. The process seems to be becoming more physical as it goes on - entire systems slide on rails like the beads of an abacus, and entire server racks act as teeth in massive gears.

**5. Seeding of the Divine RNG**

With the signal parsed finally from digital to analog it is passed to the _Manipulator_. The gilded gears and racks and pins of all sizes turn and roll over one another as they pass from an escher-like tangle of incomprehensibility into the outright impossible - driving one of many of the Tower's non-euclidian mechanisms. This one uses chaos theory or quantum something using the words "strings" and "branes" probably, to define the physical constraints of reality within the new cube. The _Divine RNG_ is set, and this "platform" is then passed to the next step.

Ezekiel's visions of angels and "wheels turning within wheels" are allusions to this machine.

**6. The Articulation of the Demulcimer**

Articulation, as in to speak or play and "Demulcimer" from the chemicals that un-mix called demulsifiers and the dulcimer.

_Magic_ is woven into the fabric of the new world through vibration. All stories of songs beyond the veil and the music of the spheres are allusions to this process. While the seeding of the RNG sets the physical constants and the rules of order, it is the silk spun of this great spool that determines how flexible these bounds are, what the punishments for breaking them look like. The song is part of the echo heard on the radio throughout the tower.

In the scientific lingo of your cube, it's the Big Bang. The bounds of your world are such that one cannot know the subtleties of the sound it made. You are permitted light, music, and the powers of a _Card-Wielder_ signs that the constraints aren't as tight as they could have been.

Worlds dissimilar to Oran's have usually caught by a failsafe already, which purges them for another attempt. Worlds too drastically different (in the scope of the capabilities of the _Divine RNG_ and the _Song_) aren't easy to find in the tower.

The physical constraints of the world within the cube are now set. It enters stasis.

**6.1 (Optional) Cube Relocation**

The cube is moved by tower mechanisms to unoccupied space for it to unfold into.

**7. Electrovitic Inception**

The tower connects access tunnels, canals, bridges, supports, etc. to the cube. A huge power surge from somewhere in the tower zaps the cube with the trite and true fantasy life-beginning lightning zap. This signals the cube to leave its stasis-state. Time begins inside the cube and it unfolds/expand to its full size.

**8. Patrinitiation Broadcast**

Now housed in its new location the tower assembles the cube a broadcast node and it is inaugurated with a broadcast of its metadata. This alerts the agencies of its position.

**9. Agency Connection Establishment**

Now the cube is running the agencies can play their role and set up outposts or transport/delivery links. The first wave of Agents prepare themselves and their resources for intervention within.

**10. Firing of The Eon Cannon**

The Tower focuses a blast of an _Eon Beam_ on the Cube, speeding along the universe until solar systems in galaxies the older parts of the universe inside have time to settle.

**11. Firmament Vitiation**

What you had heard called the late heavy bombardment, actually the work of agencies on their initial visit working to shuttle equipment to the most earth-like planets (and sometimes obliterate the others) to speed up the development of a world and its history.

**12. The "Hollow Scene"**

Long before the Oran Inquest. The period of waiting for life to emerge and letting the hominids evolve. Basically the first part of Space Odyssey. Relatively low Agency involvement.

**13. The Holocene**

Humanoids out and about writing their own history up to today. Period of maximum Agency involvement.

**14. Oran Inquest**

Broken. The part where Polonius would appraise the world.

**15. The Midden**

The state in which most cubes currently exist; The product of the broken Oran inquest, the unmanaged state in which a world is left post-inquisition. Any world between "oran-like" and reclaimed is in the Midden. Agencies monitor these worlds, checking in as civilisation rises and falls and rises again.

**16. Reclamation**

The un-creation of the universe, the destruction of everything inside it. The apocalypse.

**17. Orgone Donation**

The process of cleaning the cube's interior once all is destroyed.

**18. Full-Frame Disassembly**

The folding-up and reclamation of the cube's shielding, presumably to be used for future projects.
